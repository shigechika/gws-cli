# Fork: gws with MCP server support

This repository is a fork of [googleworkspace/cli](https://github.com/googleworkspace/cli).

It maintains the **MCP (Model Context Protocol) server** that upstream removed, allowing AI agents to call Google Workspace APIs directly.

## Differences from upstream

| Feature | upstream | This fork |
|---|---|---|
| MCP server (`gws mcp`) | Removed | Maintained |
| MCP helper tools (`--helpers`) | N/A | `gmail_send` and more |
| CI/CD workflows | Upstream-specific | Minimal (CI + Policy + Sync) |

### MCP server

Dynamically generates tools from Discovery Documents and serves them via the MCP protocol over stdio.

```bash
# Start MCP server for Gmail with helper tools
gws mcp -s gmail --helpers

# Serve multiple services
gws mcp -s gmail -s drive -s calendar --helpers

# Compact mode (one tool per service)
gws mcp -s gmail --tool-mode compact
```

### MCP helper tools

Enabled with the `--helpers` flag. These provide high-level operations on top of the raw Discovery API tools, automating tedious tasks like RFC 2822 formatting and base64url encoding.

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `gmail_send` | Send email. Just pass to/subject/body — RFC 2822 formatting and base64url encoding are handled automatically |
| `gmail_reply` | Reply within a thread. Pass message_id/body — In-Reply-To, References, Re: subject, and threadId are set automatically |

## Installation

The upstream npm package does not include MCP support. Build from source:

```bash
# Install directly from GitHub (recommended)
cargo install --git https://github.com/shigechika/gws-mcp --locked
```

If you cloned the repository locally, install from the working tree:

```bash
cd gws-mcp
cargo install --path crates/google-workspace-cli
```

This installs the binary to `~/.cargo/bin/gws`. Note that `cargo build --release` only builds to `target/release/gws` and does **not** update `~/.cargo/bin/`.

## Usage with Claude

**Claude Code** — add to `~/.claude.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gws": {
      "command": "gws",
      "args": ["mcp", "-s", "gmail", "-s", "drive", "-s", "calendar", "--helpers"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Claude Desktop** — add to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gws": {
      "command": "gws",
      "args": ["mcp", "-s", "gmail", "-s", "drive", "-s", "calendar", "--helpers"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Upstream MCP issues addressed in this fork

Bug reports and feature requests that targeted upstream's MCP server (closed when MCP was removed). This fork ports the fixes so they remain useful:

| Upstream issue | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| [#162](https://github.com/googleworkspace/cli/issues/162) — `tools/list` returns uncallable tool names for aliased services | Fixed | `walk_resources` now uses the configured service alias as tool-name prefix (instead of Discovery doc name), so `tools/list` and `tools/call` share one namespace |
| [#170](https://github.com/googleworkspace/cli/issues/170) — Tool name parsing breaks on multi-word resources (`admin_role_assignments_list` etc.) | Fixed | Replaced `split('_')` with a greedy Discovery-tree resolver (`resolve_tool_path`). Handles arbitrarily nested resources whose names contain underscores |
| [#212](https://github.com/googleworkspace/cli/issues/212) — Full-mode schemas expose `body`/`upload` on GET-only methods | Fixed | `body` is added only when `method.request.is_some()`; `upload` only when `supports_media_upload` is true |
| [#251](https://github.com/googleworkspace/cli/issues/251) — Dynamic `--upload` accepts unsafe absolute/traversal paths | Fixed | MCP `upload` argument rejects absolute paths and `..` components |
| [#260](https://github.com/googleworkspace/cli/issues/260) — Tool annotations (`readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`, `idempotentHint`) | Partial | Annotations derived from HTTP method are now attached to every tool. `tool_search` meta-tool and pagination from the original proposal are not yet ported |
| [#642](https://github.com/googleworkspace/cli/issues/642) — `parse_message_headers` case-sensitive match drops CC/headers with non-canonical casing | Fixed | Normalized header names to lowercase before matching, so `"CC"` from Exchange/Outlook, `"from"` lowercase, etc. are all recognized per RFC 5322 §1.2.2 |

## Upstream MCP timeline

| Date | Event |
|---|---|
| 2026-03-04 | `feat: add gws mcp server` — MCP server added to upstream |
| 2026-03-05 | Branch `fix/mcp-hyphen-tool-names` appeared in upstream — tool name separator change from underscore to hyphen |
| 2026-03-06 | `fix!: Remove MCP server mode` — MCP server removed from upstream as a breaking change, just 2 days after introduction |
| 2026-03-06 | Branch `fix/mcp-hyphen-tool-names` deleted without being merged — MCP remains absent from upstream |

## Upstream sync policy

- Weekly auto-merge from upstream/main via GitHub Actions (every Monday)
- Conflicts trigger a PR for manual resolution
- MCP-related code (`src/mcp_server.rs`, `pub(crate)` visibility, MCP bridge façade functions) is preserved as top priority
- Issue/PR number references (`#123`) are stripped from upstream commit messages to prevent cross-references
